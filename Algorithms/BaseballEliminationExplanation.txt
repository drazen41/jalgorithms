We would also like to explain the reason for the team's elimination to a friend in nontechnical terms (using only grade-school arithmetic). 
Here's such an explanation for Detroit's elimination in the American League East example above. With the best possible luck, Detroit finishes the season with 49 + 27 = 76 wins. 
Consider the subset of teams R = { New York, Baltimore, Boston, Toronto }. Collectively, they already have 75 + 71 + 69 + 63 = 278 wins; there are also 3 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 7 = 27 remaining games among them, 
so these four teams must win at least an additional 27 games. Thus, on average, the teams in R win at least 305 / 4 = 76.25 games. 
Regardless of the outcome, one team in R will win at least 77 games, thereby eliminating Detroit.
